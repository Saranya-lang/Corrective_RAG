# Corrective_RAG
✅ What is Corrective RAG?
Corrective RAG is an enhanced version of Simple RAG where the system:

Retrieves documents relevant to the question.

Generates an initial answer using a language model.

Validates or corrects that answer by comparing it to the retrieved documents (e.g., to detect hallucinations or misinterpretation).

Regenerates the final answer if needed, ensuring it stays true to the source documents.

📌 Why Use Corrective RAG?
Because LLMs sometimes “hallucinate” — meaning they generate fluent but incorrect answers. Corrective RAG helps catch and fix those before they reach the user.
